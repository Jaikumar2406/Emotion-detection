# Emotion Detection

## Overview
Emotion Detection is a deep learning-based project that identifies human emotions from images. Given an image of a person's face, the trained model predicts the corresponding emotion, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

## Features
- Predicts emotions from facial images
- Uses a deep learning model for classification
- Simple and easy-to-use implementation

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Jaikumar2406/Emotion-detection>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

## Usage
Run the model to predict emotions from an image:
```bash
python emotion.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Install them using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by improving the model, adding more emotions, or enhancing the prediction accuracy.
