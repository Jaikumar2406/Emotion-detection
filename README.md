Emotion Detection
Overview
Emotion Detection is a deep learning-based project that identifies human emotions from facial images. Given an image of a person's face, the trained model predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify emotions accurately and can be further improved with better data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or a more complex model architecture.

Features
✅ Facial Emotion Recognition – Predicts emotions from facial expressions.
✅ Deep Learning-Based Model – Uses CNN (or other architectures like ResNet, VGG) for classification.
✅ Easy-to-Use Implementation – Simple script to test and predict emotions from images.

Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Jaikumar2406/Emotion-detection
cd Emotion-detection
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

bash
Copy

Usage
To run the model and predict emotions from an image, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
🔹 Modify predict.py to load the trained model and preprocess the input image correctly.

Dependencies

Future Improvements 🚀
🔹 Improve Model Accuracy – Try data augmentation, fine-tuning, or transfer learning.
🔹 Add More Emotion Classes – Currently detects basic emotions; can be extended.
🔹 Optimize Performance – Reduce inference time for real-time emotion detection.
